# axios-project

## Project Description
A simple application where we use Vue.js and consume an API. The application takes a list of movies and allows the user to display the movies in the list and to search a certain movie by its title. The movies that contain the characters in the search bar are automatically displayed. For the data storage Firebase Realtime Database was used and the fetching of data was implemented using Axios - a popular, promise-based HTTP client.
